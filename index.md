    title: Our Story
    text: >
      Hi!  We are Tim and Jun and we're a family of four living in sunny Southern California.  Thank you for taking the time to read our story and considering participating in our journey with us.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We knew for as long as we've been together that we wanted a family together.  We tried for years to conceive naturally without success.  We started ART treatments and went through numerous IVF rounds.  We were fortunate enough to create four healthy embryos.  However, we had one unsuccesful transfer after which our IVF clinic recommended that surrogacy was our best option to have a family of our own.  The doctor stated that Jun's previous robotic myomectomy surgery permanently damaged her uterus and endometrial lining along with her ability to carry naturally.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We know that together, with the help of an amazing surrogate, we can create the family that we have been dreaming of.  We truly appreciate, respect and love surrogates because they are not just changing the life of intended parents but also their own lives forever.  They are our angels.
