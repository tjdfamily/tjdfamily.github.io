    title: Our Story
    text: >
      <b>Hi!</b>  Nice to meet you all! Thank you for visiting our website and getting to know more about us! We are Tim and Jun and we’re a family living in sunny Southern California. Thank you for taking the time to read our story and considering participating in our Parenthood journey with us.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We knew for as long as we’ve been together that we wanted a family together. We tried for years to conceive naturally without success. We started ART treatments and went through countless IVF rounds. We were fortunate enough to create four healthy embryos. However, we had one unsuccessful transfer after which our IVF clinic recommended that surrogacy was our best option to have a family of our own.  According to the doctor, the robotic surgery Jun had performed years ago damaged her uterus along with her ability to carry naturally.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Surrogacy is hope. Surrogacy is love. We know that together, with the help of an amazing surrogate, we can create the family that we have been dreaming of. We truly appreciate, respect and love surrogates because they are not just changing the life of intended parents but also their own lives forever. They are our angels!

    title: Letter to our Surrogate
    text: >
      Dear Surrogate Mother,
      <br/><br/>
      Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and for considering participating in our journey with us.  Years ago, we could not imagine that we would be in a position to need to write this letter but life is not predictable and we appreciate that life brings you to us. We are eternally grateful that there are generous and wonderful people like yourself that are helping families realize their dreams.  
      <br/><br/>
      We have been married for six years.  We come from very different places but found love in sharing our experiences and core values and learning new things from each other.  Tim spent his earlier life in the Midwest states of America.  Jun spent her earlier life in Southern China. Jun can speak fluent Mandarin and Cantonese. We met at a party in Huntington Beach and we were the only two people not wearing costumes and came straight from work [how boring!]  Henceforth, Tim has learned about dim-sum, homemade dumplings, different kinds of tea, using chopsticks properly, and the amazing Chinese culture and philosophy.  Jun has learned about Johnsonville sausages, tacos, and backpacking. We both like good food, watching movies and documentaries, reading books, working out, hiking, camping, and outdoor adventure. Life is definitely more fun together! 
      <br/><br/>
      Jun is warm, compassionate, optimistic, humorous, and organized, who likes to make “to-do list”. Of course, she won’t forget to make a “honey do list” for Tim. Tim is sincere, friendly, calm, and logical, who likes to take Jun to explore outdoors and presents Jun with surprised gifts. We have a good marriage because we share similar core values, we value family, hard work, integrity, education, and compassion. Our differences also serve as complements to each other, and our personalities match. We both agree that the greatest marriages are built on teamwork. A mutual respect, a healthy dose of admiration, and a never-ending portion of love and grace.  
      <br/><br/>
      Tim works for a international consulting firm as a principal software architect.  His daily routine includes coffee, lots of three letter abbreviations, and developing software that we all use every day.  Jun works as the comptroller for a large risk management firm where she manages a team of accountants.  Her daily routine includes lots of emails, excel files, and virtual meetings to make sure all of the books are accurate.  We both are very fortunate that our jobs are 100% remote, even from before the COVID times when work at home was forced on the world.
      <br/><br/>
      Our home is located in a good school district that is also very close to many parks and sporting facilities.  Our child will learn the value of education, caring, and sharing.  Jun’s parents also live with us in our home.  Jun’s mom loves to take care of every one and loves to cook tasty meals for the family.  Jun’s father is still in very good health and enjoys riding the train downtown to explore the sights.  We frequently take family walks in the park and have a family of ducks we like to feed at the lake.  We are very fortunate to have financial stability and have made all the preparations for a great home environment.
      <br/><br/>
      We struggled with infertility for many years.  We have been through countless rounds of IVF cycles and a failed transfer.  Our ability to get new embryos is severely limited due to complications from a robotic surgery Jun had performed years ago.  After the failed transfer, our doctor has suggested that surrogacy is the best path for us to realize our dream of having our own family with our frozen embryos.
      <br/><br/>
      We promise that our child will have a loving home.  The child will have two loving parents and two loving grandparents caring for them under one multi-generational, multi-lingual, and multi-culture environment. Jun is a big cousin who grew up with more than 15 cousins in her extended families. She has lots of experience with children. 
      <br/><br/>
      Thank you again for reading our story and considering joining us in our most important life journey. We’re very easy going and friendly. We’re definitely open to communicating with you via phone, text message, email, and in person visits. We’ll do our best to support you and make this journey enjoyable for both of us. We believe that the most wonderful surrogacy journeys are built on trust and positive communication. Surrogacy has been described as one of the most powerful and rewarding decisions a woman can make. 
      <br/><br/>
      Thank you for considering us as your partner. Your generosity restores hope and brightens the world! We hope to get to know you soon! 
      <br/><br/>
      Warmest Regards,
      <br/><br/>
      Tim + Jun
